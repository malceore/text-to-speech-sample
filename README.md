# Text to Speech Example

Language is composed of small vocal sounds, one way to break this down is using monomemes and the Arpabet. This list of thirty something sounds can be used to compose just about all spoken english words. In this project I have recorded small snippets of audio of myself pronouncing each letter of the arparbet so that it can be played back to hear me speak the word you type into the console. We use Pyaudio and CMU opensource langauge in order to find the pronunciations of words in a generated list.

*Highly work and progress.
